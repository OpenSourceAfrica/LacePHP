## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening, abusive, or harassing.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, please report it by emailing the project maintainers at **conduct@opensourceafrica.org**. All reports will be handled with discretion.
